# Day4-Compare-Object
The function should recursively compare each element in the first object with the
corresponding element in the second object, considering various factors such as type,
value, index, key, etc. It should return true if all elements are similar and false otherwise.
The objects in question can be instances of Array, Map, or Object. It is important to note
that an element in the object can itself be another object, creating nested structures.
